2017-07-24 20:50:28	Haydos	[20:39:29] CSS framework 
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:39:32] a css framework, bulma.io

2017-07-24 20:50:28	Haydos	[20:40:13] what do you think is better about bulma compared to other things? Why should I use it? 
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:40:14] I'm using alpha-v6 in production, its pretty much ready
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:40:28] flexbox, its better than bootstrap 3. bulma is not better than bootstrap 4
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:41:03] until a week ago, bulma didnt even support dropdowns. "bulma is a css framework, not a js framework" the creator would say
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:42:34] bulmas concept of "box" and "card" are the same damn thing. I'm glad mdo is still in control of bootstrap :)
2017-07-24 20:50:28	dansup	[20:44:01] in some ways its more semantic than semantic-ui, but semantic-ui has a lot of components and has excellent react support

2017-07-25 04:51:15	ChadT	[00:43:12] if there is substantial churn.. it will suck

2017-07-29 05:07:24	Haydos	[00:55:11] veb, sure I'll be your dank founder
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:55:32] are you bamboozling me
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:55:38] I'm kinda into it
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:56:00] like, if you ever search for cannabis whatever,  you get a vBulletin forum that was founded in 2001, and has 55 pages on your search term
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:56:05] and the answer is on page 25
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:56:07] veb, weed will be legal in canada in less than a year, make a canadian version
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:56:23] dansup: I can't register canadian domain names
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:56:30] lol
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:56:31] you need to have a canadian address etc
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:56:40] fakenamegenerator bro
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:56:42] I could do dankoverflow.com/ca or somethin
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:56:53] yeah true
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:56:59] one domain would be best for SEO
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:57:02] yea
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:58:44] you could pivot, the meme economy is :fire:
2017-07-29 05:07:24	dansup	[00:58:55] turn it into a dank meme site
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:59:06] dansup: lol
2017-07-29 05:07:24	veb	[00:59:17] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BcFs8A0z/image.png
2017-07-29 05:07:30	dansup	[00:59:17] i heard the SEC was going after it
2017-07-29 05:07:30	veb	[00:59:20] check out the appname
2017-07-29 05:07:30	dansup	[00:59:39] heh
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:01:04] i tried to make a meme generator once, I dunno how imgur scales the top/bottom text based on length
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:01:16] hardest problem I ever tried to solve
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:01:53] the thing is, you could easily monetise this, if I get the traffic
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:01:58] and the question is idc
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:03] "what temp should I have..."
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:10] I can have affiliate links to heatlamps on the sidebar
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:17] but in a nice way, integrated with the site
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:22] "recommended product" sort of thing
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:28] not a random google ads bullshit
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:02:53] I can probably grow this simply by making a huge list of questions, googling them, and finding answers and rewriting them
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:04:12] yes, with legalization becoming big, it is only a matter of time before it is the next gold rush
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:04:40] i will be able to grow up to 4 plants at my house by this time next year :D
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:06:04] nice
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:06:11] yeah it's ppl like you I wanna be able to get
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:06:27] an easy place to go to with a brandable name
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:06:31] with good easy clear info
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:06:50] dansup: would you use something like stackoverflow when/if you ever grew your own plants
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:07:17] yes, esp if it had a reputation system where I could have trusted answers
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:07:34] yeah I need to work on the rep system and make that better somehow
2017-07-29 05:07:31	dansup	[01:12:42] thats a fun problem, do you go with a simple incremented vote counter, or maybe a logarithmic function that weights early votes higher than newer votes, or do you calculate votes based on a users reputation (however that is measured)
2017-07-29 05:07:31	veb	[01:14:21] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vvSDjGDs/image.png
2017-07-31 09:20:22	veb	[01:14:22] cringe
2017-07-31 09:20:22	veb	[01:14:36] dansup: yeah it's gonna be a lot of fiddling I reckon

2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:20:22] it loaded fast
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:20:56] I forgot about this, funny because I am working on my blog and I showed a screenshot to igel and he was talking about how cool it would be to pin blog posts to ipfs
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:21:18] :D
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:21:33] <@igel>	what i'm getting at: it would be pretty fking awesome to see 'pin this blog entry ipfs://0xfc00800600xxxx'
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:21:41] I also reduced the image size: 311MB -> 9.11MB
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:22:08] image size? are you using docker?
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:22:16] I think there are mirror scripts around that would be able to work on cjdns
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:22:17] yes
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:22:37] oh man, docker has really fucked me over this past week. Glad i got the bugs sorted out
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:22:54] when it works, its awesome
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:23:39] getting laravel to run with cronjob, queue, storage, mail, ect took me a bit longer than I expected. I never used docker before
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:25:09] getting the laravel ecosystem to work with it is probably a lot more work than the average docker person has to deal with
2017-07-31 09:23:33	kpcyrd	[02:25:16] there's this thing: https://12factor.net/
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:25:38] interesting
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:26:17] kpcyrd: have you thought about using localStorage so a user could keep track of previous inks?
2017-07-31 09:23:33	dansup	[02:26:54] and "history" of viewed inks would be neat
2017-07-31 09:23:34	dansup	[02:27:32] register a sw and make it a pwa, zoom zoom
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:28:25] I always wanted to use service workers, but I have no idea what I should do with it
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:29:03] oh wait, I can make the editor available offline?
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:29:16] no internet, still works?
2017-07-31 09:23:34	dansup	[02:30:55] yeah
2017-07-31 09:23:34	dansup	[02:32:12] combine serviceWorkers with localStorage and you got urself an offline syncing solution, it can handle LTE disruptions, ect
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:32:33] that'd be neat
2017-07-31 09:23:34	dansup	[02:32:37] im not sure if cryptpad does that, but I've seen it done before
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:33:10] I was thinking about saving drafts to local storage, I didn't think about having a history yet
2017-07-31 09:23:34	kpcyrd	[02:33:22] feel free to request features on github <3

Reports indicate the Rust Evangelism Strike Force was severely reduced in number after several of them attempted to read Rust code outside of an Electron-based text editor. Please send money to the Living Computers Museum in lieu of flowers.

2017-08-04 09:26:23	kpcyrd	actually, I write rust in vanilla vim
2017-08-04 09:26:39	kpcyrd	rust syntax support was merged a couple of months ago
2017-08-04 09:27:20	kpcyrd	dansup: did I tell you about the sniffer I wrote? in.. RUST?
2017-08-04 09:28:15	kpcyrd	it's like urlsnarf, except it also decodes dhcp, dns and tls handshakes
2017-08-04 09:28:28	kpcyrd	didn't finish multithreaded packet decoding tho
2017-08-04 09:30:36	kpcyrd	need to cleanup the output code before introducing threading. I also didn't assemble the hardware yet (packet arrived yesterday) and might have to upstream batman support
2017-08-04 09:31:16	kpcyrd	dansup: that should be sufficient rust mentioning for, like, two weeks? :)

2017-08-11 12:05:25	veb	[21:56:40] Before doing anything I wanted to think about how I’d approach this. In web development, I don’t do things in the proper way (e.g. I don’t use SASS, Grunt, Gulp, Node.JS, Meteor or React), instead I’m extremely pragmatic. I use a text editor and I write plain code.
2017-08-11 12:05:25	veb	[21:56:41] wtf

2017-08-11 13:17:18	TheMoonMaster	bunzz: designers should do html and css imo

2017-08-11 14:08:33	TheMoonMaster	but I agree a developer should be able to do that
2017-08-11 14:14:54	bunzz	i mean i agree i think designers should code, but i guess where i am my responsibility doesn't involve production code
2017-08-11 14:15:16	bunzz	i code for prototypes but none of that shit ever really goes into the dev team's codebase. maybe CSS but that's it

2017-08-11 14:25:15	dansup	TheMoonMaster: yeah - have you seen laravel valet? it makes local dev so nice and easy - just clone a repo and run "laravel link reponame" and its bound to reponame.dev (using dnsmasq and nginx)
2017-08-11 14:25:32	TheMoonMaster	I stay clear of PHP, so I haven't.
2017-08-11 14:25:43	TheMoonMaster	that's interesting though
2017-08-11 14:25:45	dansup	"valet secure reponame" generates a TLS cert
2017-08-11 14:26:24	TheMoonMaster	bunzz: the best experiences I've had working with designers they've owned markup/styles
2017-08-11 14:26:40	TheMoonMaster	ofc I'd work super close with them and fill in the blanks code code wise
2017-08-11 14:26:47	TheMoonMaster	dansup: that's interesting

2017-09-05 09:04:01	kpcyrd	[21:23:01] dansup: do you know a good way to convert asciinema .json to .gif locally?

2017-09-05 09:04:01	kpcyrd	[21:24:40] everything I found uses a browser to run it, then screenshot it and stitch it together to a .gif

2017-09-05 09:04:01	veb	[21:33:15] yeah don't worry about it dansup 
2017-09-05 09:04:01	kpcyrd	[21:38:19] I edited the message a couple of times trying to make it sound less weird due to language barriers, should've translated to "I'm focusing on irrelevant things"

2017-09-14 19:21:13	veb	knee was itching, my fist was gonna get that jaw
2017-09-14 19:21:20	veb	decided to go with the "i'm deaf" thing
2017-09-14 19:21:25	veb	50% chance of working
2017-09-14 19:21:52	veb	wasn't happy
2017-09-14 19:22:45	HHaydos	"I'm deaf" is probably better than an assault charge
2017-09-14 19:22:59	veb	I'd just say he touched my son first
2017-09-14 19:23:02	veb	and I was protecting us

2017-09-14 19:23:17	veb	but yeah
2017-09-14 19:25:12	veb	HHaydos: are you saying you wouldn't do anything if someone was clearly unhinged, in your 4 year old face, talking about killing people?
2017-09-14 19:25:28	veb	it's tough situation because while you know it's all talk, you don't know if this person is a violent person anyway
2017-09-14 19:25:38	HHaydos	if you can defuse it with words, you should do that 
2017-09-14 19:25:44	HHaydos	if it escalates, you should escalate 
2017-09-14 19:25:46	veb	yeah that's the #1 rule
2017-09-14 19:25:51	veb	101 in fighting
2017-09-14 19:26:10	veb	but I've never been in a situation where I've wondered if I've had to throw the first punch like that

2017-09-14 19:34:08	HHaydos	just stare him in the eye, get real close and whisper
2017-09-14 19:34:13	HHaydos	"do it, fgt"

2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:48:53] cos you can't use md5 for des
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:48:56] why? 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:48:59] yeah 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:49:03] des must be 8-16 I think
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:49:10] 1 - 8 bytes
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:49:16] same for 3des
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:50:21] could try the first 8 characters of the md5 string?
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:50:23] lol
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:52:14] so maybe it is AES? 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:52:24] because we can decrypt AES if we have the key 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:52:59] AES is 32 bytes 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:53:18] 256 bits right?
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[22:53:39] md5 is 128 bits yeah?
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:54:29] 128 key length
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:54:56] must be an AES key then 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	HHaydos	[22:55:04] and the key is md5
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[23:03:58] I think you're looking for a hex HHaydos 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[23:10:18] hey HHaydos 
2017-09-15 09:09:10	veb	[23:10:23] could they be messing with you
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:10:31] Oh we forgot to mention, the keys are also encrypted using an MD5 hashing algorithm, base64 encoding and a Caeser Cipher with shift 6... good luck!
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:10:34] so the first key is md5
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:10:39] the second one was done with base64
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:10:44] and third one was done with caeser cipher?
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:11:02] oh four keys ;_;
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[23:12:34] hmmmmm

2017-09-15 09:09:11	HHaydos	[00:53:27] I gotta find a way to decrypt AES 
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[00:53:28] neither tbh
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[00:53:39] have fun I guess
2017-09-15 09:09:11	HHaydos	[00:53:44] I suspect we caesar, b64 then md5 because the key length is 32 char
2017-09-15 09:09:11	HHaydos	[00:53:50] 128 bit 
2017-09-15 09:09:11	veb	[00:57:52] gl

2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[20:58:13] lol
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[20:58:26] just look like the kinda person to do things like that
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ffwacom	[20:58:57] great
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[20:59:23] is it fun?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[20:59:26] I've wanted to try it
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ffwacom	[20:59:53] yeah, legs shake heaps at the start
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ffwacom	[20:59:59] like you have parkinsons
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:00:00] these guys used to do it by where I used to flat when I was at uni
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ffwacom	[21:00:03] but 20mins later and it's fine
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:00:05] and they were always australians
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:00:08] lol
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ffwacom	[21:00:09] haha
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:14:12] what do you do after a 1 hour client call?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:15:14] ChadT: php ?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:15:38] ... someone wants us to replicate what this wordpress plugin does
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:16:22] lol, wordpress codebase is "not fun" their is a function for everything
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:17:00] ChadT: poor you
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:17:01] i tell my clients either laravel or find someone else. i dont do wordpress, joomla or drupal anymore
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:17:01] that sucks
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:17:15] ChadT: can't you just buy the wp plugin :P
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:17:58] tbh, all it does is ping a google api and store the result
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:18:03] so.. no dramas there
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:18:10] most wordpress plugins are just javascript libs with an admin setting to enable/disable
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:18:34] like that sketchy revolution slider that pwn'd half the internet a few years ago
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:18:55] oh?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:19:17] so many cms's and php projects still md5 or sha1 the users password instead of using bcrypt
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:19:51] tis why php has such a bad rep, the symfony framework is doing gods work
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:20:18] authentication and authorization.. is actually.. hard as hell :/
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:20:28] outsourcing to things like auth0 ftw
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:21:55] for oauth or 2fa ?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:22:24] oh is a QR code generator 2fa plugin? 
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:23:37] had a client that didnt like google so I had to change the instructions to use Authy and generate the 2fa QR code locally, lol
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:25:29] php artisan make:auth 
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:25:36] using laravel its real easy :P
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:26:11] generates the view/controller scaffolding, just need to provide accurate db creds
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:26:44] and what if you don't want to store the auth creds?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:28:55] why wouldn't you want to store the auth creds?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:29:39] becuase I do not want to have that info in my db
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:29:47] yet another responsibility to manage
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:30:42] you are giving a 3rd party the most valuable ting doh, do you even store their email?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:31:27] what if auth0 becomes unavailable, a user can't log in?
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:32:30] im not sure what life is like in .net land, but managing users is standard in php. Not hard to use password_verify() as a timing-safe password validation for login
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:41:16] do I store their email? hell no
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:41:56] there are fully fledged identity systems in .net
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:42:05] I've just decided that... it's better to outsource 
2017-09-25 10:48:02	veb	[21:42:38] lol
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:42:42] once you have multiple oauth providers, local logins, 2fa, various different claim supports
2017-09-25 10:48:02	ChadT	[21:43:22] yadda yadda..
2017-09-25 10:48:02	dansup	[21:59:18] lol, if this is for a client... then who cares. But I wouldn't do this for my own stuff

2017-10-25 19:59:07	Haydos	[18:41:40] I'm in a good malware analysis group and a good region specific security group. 
2017-10-25 19:59:07	Haydos	[18:42:15] Nomad List is pretty average, gun.io is okay but I don't really go there, regional startup team is okay but slow, Elixir chat is medium.
