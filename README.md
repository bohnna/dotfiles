# My Dotfiles
Just a collection of dotfiles for me to keep my workflow organized. Many of my settings are derived from looking at the collection of dotfiles of various programmers. My dotfiles are hosted on github not only so that I can sync my new settings across my desktop and laptop, but also to make everything portable and easy to set up. 

If you're trying to get yourself set up, I recommend taking a look at http://dotfiles.github.io/
